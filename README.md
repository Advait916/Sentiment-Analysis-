# Sentiment-Analysis-

I have performed the sentiment analysis of customers who bought a particular cell phone. I used a dataset called Cell_Phones_and_Accessories. I cleaned and reviewed the data, and gave a score accordinlgy. If the customer gave the product a score ranging from 0-3 the model will give you a score of 0 and if the customer gave the product a score of 4 or above then the model will give you a score of 1.
